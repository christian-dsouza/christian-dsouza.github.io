            My name is Christian Ethan D'Souza. I was born on October 6th, 2002 in Dubai, UAE.
            I moved to Vaughan, Canada when I was 11 years old and attended St. Elizabeth Catholic High School.
            It was in Grade 9 when I was first introduced to coding, and since taking my first course
            in Grade 10, I've never looked back. I've enjoyed the learning process in programming, and it
            has certainly helped that my friends are developers themselves. I am currently in my fourth
            year of Computing at Queen's University, the period I've learned most of my programming skills
            from. I'm always thinking about the future, and I strive to make significant contributions to
            any task I take part in.

            Playing sports is one of the ways I try to maintain a healthy
            lifestyle. My competitive nature allows me to have a good time when 
            playing sports, and motivates me to stay energized and active. My 
            interest in fitness has also influenced me to go to the gym consistently.

            My favourite sport is tennis! I have been playing tennis since I was 7 
            years old, and have enjoyed training and competing. To this day, I still 
            follow the sport closely, and have been fortunate to watch some of my
            favourite players compete live! My favourite player is Roger Federer.

            Music has been a great addition to my past-time activities since I was a teenager. I enjoy
            listening to music on bike rides and long drives, and it often helps me focus when I'm studying or
            working out.
            I've been playing the guitar since I was in high school and enjoy getting together for jams.

        <p style="font-size: 110%;">
            Some of my preferred genres are Rock/Pop Punk. I take plenty of inspiration from well-known
            bands such as Queen, Green Day, and blink-182, as well as modern bands such 
            as Neck Deep and WSTR.
