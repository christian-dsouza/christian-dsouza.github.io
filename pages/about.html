        Playing sports is one of the ways I try to maintain a healthy
        lifestyle. My competitive nature allows me to have a good time when 
        playing sports, and motivates me to stay energized and active. My 
        interest in fitness has also influenced me to go to the gym consistently.

        My favourite sport is tennis! I have been playing tennis since I was 7 
        years old, and have enjoyed training and competing. To this day, I still 
        closely follow the sport and have been fortunate enough to watch some 
        professionals compete live! My favourite player is Roger Federer.
